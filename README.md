- Columns: date, store, item, sales

2. Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

3. Key Features

- Performed EDA to identify trends by date, store, and item
- Created time-based features: day, month, weekday
- Built a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
